New Time Tracking UI/UX & other issues

- UI/UX:

UI1. Table context menu (3-dotted icon) and clear fiters icons are not vertically aligned with column name
UI2. Bad contrast ratio colors in navbar tooltips. Light blue vs white & Light blue vs Dark Blue
UI3. User info columns filters dropdown. No margin between search field and first checkbox item.
UI4. Rounded borders vs squared borders in windows, tables, popups/modals, and React native buttons in the entire app.
UI5. Time Tracking navbar tab has a tooltip, but the other tabs have not.
UI6. Number inputs arrows in Time Tracking pages calendar tables are not necessary.
UI7. Time Tracking calendar day picker show only the year number instead of January in the month selector, which is confusing.
UI8. Login credentials error text bad contrast ratio red vs. background
UI9. User panel dropdown tooltip (Log out) overlaps with Help icon tooltip
UI10. Monthly summary: Mouse type is a caret instead of a cursor/pointer when hovering the calendar header, which is clickable to open the picker. This should be as it is in the time tracking record time page.
UI11. User info (managers): Mouse type is a caret instead of a cursor/pointer when hovering the team table row, which are clickable to open each specific user's page.

- Other issues:

OTH1. Error page for not found URLs (Example: timetracking.zurich.com/thisisawrongurl)
OTH2. Restricted access pages are accessible by users whose role should not allow them to access those pages.
